To set up your environment and install the required packages, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Python and create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   - Install Python: You can download and install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org).
   - Create a virtual environment (optional): Open a terminal or command prompt and execute the following command:
     ```
     python -m venv myenv
     ```
     This will create a new virtual environment named "myenv".

2. Activate the virtual environment (if created):

   - Windows:
     ```
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install the required packages by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install numpy pandas jupyter matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn nltk
   ```

4. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

   - In the terminal or command prompt, run the following command:
     ```
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser.

5. Inside the Jupyter Notebook, create a new Python notebook or open an existing one.

6. Import the NLTK library and download the necessary resources:
   - In a notebook cell, type the following code:
     ```python
     import nltk
     nltk.download('stopwords')
     nltk.download('wordnet')
     nltk.download('omw-1.4')
     ```
   - Execute the cell by pressing Shift+Enter.
   - This will download the required NLTK resources for stopwords, WordNet, and Open Multilingual Wordnet.

You should now have the necessary packages installed and the NLTK resources downloaded.
